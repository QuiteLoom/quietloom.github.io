🧵 QuietLoom
Calm, offline tools for a quieter digital life.

QuietLoom is a small collection of handcrafted apps designed to help you read, write, plan, and live — without the noise of the modern internet.
No accounts. No cloud. No tracking. Everything stays local, private, and completely yours.

We call this collection the Paperlight Suite:
a set of minimalist utilities inspired by notebooks, journals, planners, and quiet moments.

🔧 Philosophy

QuietLoom apps are built around three principles:

1. Offline-First

Your tools should work anywhere — without accounts, servers, or connections.

2. Privacy by Default

Your data belongs to you.
No syncing, no analytics, no tracking. No selling of Data. Ever.

3. Calm Software

Minimal interfaces, soft aesthetics, and no dopamine loops or digital noise.

📦 Goals of the Project

Provide free, open-source CLI tools for personal organization

Offer paid GUI versions later for those who want a polished visual experience

Keep everything local and transparent

Build a cohesive suite that supports real life, not distracts from it
